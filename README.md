# systelab-snapshot-testing

This project started after viewing a Ng-conf 2018 talk called "Protractor: A New Hope" by Mike Giambalvo and Craig Nishina, both developers at Google.

Please check https://github.com/angular-seattle/blue-harvest for the original repository which contains the ideas than inspired me.
